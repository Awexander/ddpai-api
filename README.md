## DDPAI DASHCAM API ##
minimal python wrapper to communicate with DDPAI dashcam.
this module can communicate to read following queries from DDPAI dashcam:

1. mailbox
2. front camera playback
3. rear camera playback
4. front camera event
5. rear camera event
6. parking event

## GPS data are not available through this module because my dashcam does not have that capabilities to do so but you can still get the response from your dashcam through api listed in api.py
